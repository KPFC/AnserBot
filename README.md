PHP mediawiki bot
This repo contains various scripts for doing automated edits on mediawiki wikis. To run the scripts, you need to install the Cygnus framework (https://github.com/ToolsnBots/Cygnus) into a subfolder named “Core”.
After you have done this you have to setup your Password.php and change the user-specific things in the scripts.
